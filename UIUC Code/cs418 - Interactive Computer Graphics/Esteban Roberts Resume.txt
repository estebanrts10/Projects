University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign        August 2017 - May 2021
B.S. in Computer Engineering


SKILLS


* Strong in C++ and Python
* Proficiency in C, Git, Arduino Environment, and Javascript
* Experience using CMake, Assembly Language, HTML, Java, CSS, System Verilog, CUDA, WGSL, and Vim


PROJECTS


Asynchronous Web Server
* Developed an asynchronous Web server using an ESP32-S2 microcontroller to monitor the health of a plant in real time using various sensors all encapsulated into a single device.
* Implemented front end of Web server to allow user input for sensor bounds. [a]
* Used ESP32-S2 to connect to Wifi while sending and receiving information to sensors and the Web server.
* Modified Arduino IDE to allow it to be compatible with the unsupported ESP32-S2.


Linux Based Operating System
* Implemented a Linux based operating system using C++ and x86 assembly language.
* The operating system consisted of a command line interpreter that supported context switching, paging, keyboard inputs, and simple file system.
* Worked in a four student team in order to effectively manage the workload.


Naive Bayes Algorithm
* Used the Naive Bayes algorithm to train a classifier to know good movie reviews from bad ones.
* Took 8,000 training examples, marked either positive or negative to then classify an additional 5,000 developmental examples between bad and good reviews.


Photo Mosaic
* Implemented a photo mosaic in C++ using a nearest neighbor search algorithm and K-D trees to create a picture by sorting smaller pictures by color.
